### :tennis: Trouble in Tennis Town! :tennis:

The people of Tennis Town have all the balls and rackets they need, but their scoring system has gone down!

They need you to create a new scoring system for them to use, which you can create using the magical powers JS has to offer.

#### Getting Started

- You'll need Node.js, VSCode, and Git installed on your machine
  - [Download Node.js](https://nodejs.org/en/)
  - [Download Visual Studio Code](https://code.visualstudio.com/download)
  - [Download Git](https://git-scm.com/downloads)
- In VSCode, open the folder containing the cloned project, it's called "javascript-training"
- In the terminal within VSCode, clone the repository using the following HTTPS option
  - `git clone https://jordanwills123@bitbucket.org/jordanwillsrepos/javascript-training.git`
- In the terminal within VSCode, run the command `npm install`
- Once finished, you'll be able to run the command `npm run test` to fully test your functions

#### What Next?

Within the `scripts` folder in your repository, there is a file named `tennis-logic.js`, in there you can create ES6 compatible functions and use them by default in the spec file, which is located at `tests\trouble-in-tennis-town.spec.js`

Once you've created functions, you can use them in the spec file by using `tennis.` followed by the name of the function, easy as pie :D

#### The Rules!

- No cheating - Using the internet for functions is allowed, copying a similar project entirely is not, and trust me, I'll know!
- No stressing - This is a gauge of skill, not a benchmark, there's no failing and certainly no repercussions. Afterwards, help and advice can be given but there will be no criticism.
- No editing - Don't mess with the tests, again, it's not that serious so if you can't manage a part then we can always go back and review it later :)

#### What if I'm Completely Stuck?
